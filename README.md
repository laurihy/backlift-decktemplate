## What is this

This is a template for Backlift (www.backlift.com). It provides a boilerplate for creating nice HTML-based slide decks.

### TODO

It's still work in progress. Currently there's a nice basic layouts, but for example following functionality is missing:
- embeddable forms using Backlift backend (e.g. collecting emails)
- another starting template, with light colors
- more and more general purpose templates, that would be easier to use
- improve plotting library

Mission: to be Twitter Bootstrap for slide decks :)
